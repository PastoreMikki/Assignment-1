Business Administration gives you the strategic edge, and Data Engineering equips you with the tools to shape decisions with data. Here are five realistic project ideas that beautifully blend both my current background in Business Management with my future goal of becoming a data engineer;
- Customer Defection Prediction Dashboard
- Supply Chain Optimization Using Big Data
- Automated Financial Reporting System
- Market Sentiment Analyzer for Strategic Planning
- Employee Performance and Retention Analytics Tool.
Each of these projects not only strengthens your technical skills but also positions you to speak the language of business fluently, which is golden in the world of data engineering.
